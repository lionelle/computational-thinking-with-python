# Computational Thinking with Python

This book is meant to present a means to learn computational thinking while learning python programming. Some programming books attempt to teach a language, while hoping you develop a better understanding of computational thinking and how to design programs by learning the language. This book approaches the problem as a means to help you develop a new way of looking at the world, while learning a programming language to help one better understand these new concepts and problems.

## Think Like A Programmer
Guess what, everyone can think like a programmer! Really! However, the journey involves you to start looking at the world in different ways, and more importantly, looking at problems in different ways. Arguably, the primary job of a computer scientist is using technology as a means to solve problems. A corollary to that, is that *computer scientists seek to solve the worlds largest and hardest problems using technology as a means to solve them*! Most programmers want to make the world a better place. It could be made better by providing entertainment to people, such as the case of gaming, or it could be figuring out ways to minimize trip distances of delivery trucks reducing the overall fuel consumption at a large scale. Both are ways to make the world a better, and programming is means to help create, using both logical structures and creativity, to build repeatable recipes (also called formulas or functions) for machines to follow. 

The real challenge is developing a mindset in how to look at the problem, especially very large problems. A good computer scientist has to think large, seeing the entire picture, and then be able to break their point of view down to the small scale of solving a piece of the problem. This leads to the idea of **computational thinking**, and that is the primary skill set introduction to programming is seeking to teach!




### Computational Thinking
Computational thinking is commonly broken up into four categories of thinking:

* Decomposition 
* Pattern Recognition
* Abstraction
* Algorithmic Design

**Decomposition** the ability to take data and problems and break them up into smaller parts, often using **Abstraction** as a means to represent those concepts in a more generalized manner. **Pattern Recognition** both for seeing patterns in the data, and patterns in problems and tasks that have to be done, and **Algorithmic Design** the ability to setup a repeatable recipe to follow. These tasks are all essential to computer science, and learned throughout the years of practice. Another way to look at these tasks is Divide-Conquer-Glue.

### Divide-Conquer-Glue

Take any problem, no matter how large, and **divide** it into smaller parts. As you divide look for ways to represent the data and the problem itself in more generalized manners. This step involves decomposition, abstraction, and pattern recognition. Once you hit a piece that you can solve, **conquer** it by developing a repeatable set of algorithms. After that piece is solved, **glue** the pieces back together until the final problem is solved. A pattern will often emerge in which you can glue the pieces in different ways to solve different problems. This simple thought pattern is at the heart of programming at computational thinking - and can be applied to any domain. 

## Book Layout
This book is layed out in such a manner that you will return to every topic! That is right. If you don't fully understand the first time, you will be presented with opportunities to go over the topics but in more depth. Each chapter represents a portion of a topic to be presented, and as such, you will find there are more chapters than a traditional book. Furthermore, within each section there will be activities to be accomplished while reading, and end of chapter activity options to be worked on. Finally, you will see a number of 'call outs' throughout the book, like the one below. These tidbits are for extra and related information about the topics.

:class: tip
This book is based heavily on principles of cognitive recall and understanding. The focus is to work with how your brain works, instead of just presenting topics to learn. As such, you will find topics are intentionally spaced and broken into subtopics, and one will continually return to a topic at set points, spiraling deeper into the subject. This is an evidence based practice that shows both improved recall and later performance of computer science topics.

When coming across cognition activities, it is highly recommend you participate in them fully, you will receive ample benefits in the future.

Overall, you will find the book is setup in a manner that it can easily be used both as slides and as a book. This is intentional, as most of programming is exploring and learn by hands on application.
