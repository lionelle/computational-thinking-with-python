## Glossary
```{glossary}

Assignment Operator
    The `=` sign used to assign a value to a variable.

Binary File
    Files only readable by a computer.

Boolean
    A value that as only two possible states, True or False, 1 or 0, etc.

Client
    The person interacting with your program, often called a user. 

docstring
    A specific string of text immediately after a function or class definition that gets stored in the __doc__ parameter of the object. Used to pull up information and for documenting what a function does. 

Dynamically Typed
    Type values for variables are determined at runtime, but must still adhere to rules for those variable types.

File Extension
    .value that helps computers determine which program to read a file with. Common extensions include .txt for text, .csv for comma separated values, .html for webpages, .docx for word docs, etc.

Files
    A way in which information is saved on the computer or other devices.

Function
    A function breaks code up into logical blocks for reuse throughout our code. A building block of all programming. 

Hardware
    The physical components of a computer. Hard Drives, Processors, Monitor, mouse, keyboard, etc

IDE
    Integrated Development Environment. These are applications designed for programming and programmers in mind. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the `Python Package`(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) installed and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) are popular ones for python programming. 

Input Devices
    Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepads, etc

Interrupter
    A program that reads code and converts it into machine readable actions.

Invoke
    The action of calling a function with parameter values passed into it.

Logic Errors
    Everything in the program works, but it doesn't work correctly based on the defined problem. For example, a function that is supposed
    to times a number by -1, instead just subtracts one. 

Operating System
    A group of programs that interact with both your program and the hardware of the computer. Systems are essential to all programs.

Operation
    A command to be executed.
    
Output Devices
    Monitor, Printer, VR Goggles, etc

Parameter
    The value that is required for a function to work. It ends up becoming a variable for use within the scope of the function. 

PEMDAS
    Order of evaluation for arithmetic expressions in python.  Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" 
    
Program
    A repeatable recipe for the computer to follow.

Programming Language
    A tool in which we learn to play the computer that follows specific grammar rules so other programs can parse the grammars to be used directly on the computer. 

Recursion
    Functions are repeating by calling themselves until they reach a base case. 

Runtime Errors
    Errors that happen while the programming is running that cause the program to crash. These programs have valid syntax but when they run they
    come across unexpected situations. For example, entering "hi" when they were supposed to enter "22" throws a ValueFormat error. These
    errors often show up as exceptions or simply crash the program.

Statically Typed
    Languages that require the type to be defined when writing the program, and prevents the program from compiling if the type is not correct.

Syntax Errors
    Errors before the program is complied or interrupted. Often errors in the formatting of the program (spacing, order, etc) or spelling of commands.

Text File
    Human readable files, mapped to common standards.

Variable
    A way we can name a value to use it again later. For example: `x = 2 + 2` and then later `print(x)`, we print 4 to the screen.

.py
    Common python file extension. It says this *text file* is setup to be read as a python code.
