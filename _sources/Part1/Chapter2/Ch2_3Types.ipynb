    "\n",
    "In the first chapter, we introduced three types of data that you will work with in your programs. Two of the types are numerical fixed values, while the third type is string sequential value. They are `int`, `float`, and `str`. What does that exactly mean for each?\n",

    "* **int**: A whole number (no decimal)  \n",
    "* **float**: a floating point number (has a decimal)\n",
    "* **str**: a sequence of characters in order - essentially words but also includes special characters, numbers, etc\n",

    "## Type Hints for Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "While including the type of the value is not required in python, it is industry standard to include \"type hints\" when dealing with functions. These hints are written in the format\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "parameter: type\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, If we had a function that needs an int to work, we would write\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_func(value : int):\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "    # returns nothing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add a return value by adding the `-> type` before the colon at the end \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_fund2(value : int, pi : float, name : str) -> str:\n",
    "    #takes in three arguments\n",
    "    #returns a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This does multiple things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Follows industry standard\n",
    "2. Allows type checking programs to double check your code for you\n",
    "3. Allows auto code completion utilities to help with docstring\n",
    "4. Most importantly, helps you to see exactly what is needed for each function without reading the full details!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "````{note}\n",
    "You can also use `None` to indicate nothing is being returned. For example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_func(value : int) -> None:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "    # returns nothing\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you write a function, you should follow these four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* define\n",
    "* document\n",
    "* implement\n",
    "* test\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **define** stage, if we set our types for the function, we will have a clearer image going into all stages! For the rest of this book, we will include type hints in our example code. \n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} Thinking Deeper - Statically Typed vs. Dynamically Typed\n",
    ":class: Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes these types are explicit in languages such as java, c, c++, and these are called {term}`Statically Typed` languages. Meaning your code must only store that specific type in a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In java for example \n",
    "```java\n",
    "int x = 10;\n",
    "x = \"Hello\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "The code above is invalid, it would throw a syntax error when you compiled the program (even before you ran it!). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, python is a {term}`Dynamically Typed` which means the variable types are determined at run time, and they may even change during the execution of program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In python, this is valid code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "x = \"Hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable x is first a number and then it is a string! This has advantages and disadvantages. To the programmer, we don't have to worry about adding types for every line of our program. It, however, can introduce runtime errors! \n",
    "\n",
    "While Dynamic vs Static typing is a common argument among language designers, what you need need to know now is **be careful**. Make sure you document, and define exactly what is expected and going on. This is especially true when dealing with function parameters. Identify what they are, so you know when you call the function both what it needs to work and what to expect on the return. \n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Now having a better understanding of types, and having introduced the Boolean type, we can talk about Conditional Statements!"
