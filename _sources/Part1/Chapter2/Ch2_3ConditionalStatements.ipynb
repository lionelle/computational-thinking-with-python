    "In this section we will expand the number of our operations. In the past, we talked about typical math operations of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `=` .

    "\n",
    "| Condition | Prose | Example | print(answer) |\n",
    "| -- | :-- | --: | :--: |\n",
    "| $a >  b$| is $a$ *greater than* $b$ | answer = 10 > 5 | True |\n",
    "| $a < b$ | is $a$ *less than* $b$ | age = 50 <br> answer = age < 100 | True|\n",
    "| $a >= b$  | is $a$ *greater than or equal to* $b$ | age = 42<br>meaning = 42<br> answer = age >= meaning| True |\n",
    "| $a <= b$  | is $a$ *less than or equal to* $b$ | answer = 5 <= 5| True |\n",
    "| $a == b$  | is $a$ *equal to* $b$ | meaning = 42<br>answer = meaning == 42| True |\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that conditional operators evaluate both sides of the statement based on the operator / operation type, and then a Boolean value is returned. You need to make sure the types are the same, or it can be a bit funny how it works. For example, if we are taking input in from a client, we need to convert that to a number before we run our comparison. \n",
