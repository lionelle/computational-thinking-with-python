Only two functions do not require others to be implemented, so that is a very good place to start.

You have **ONE** task only, complete a function that takes in two values, and lets you know if the values are equal, or if one is lower or higher than the other. That is it!

    "\n",
    "A function isn't completed until all the steps above are completed. After it is completed, you can just *use* the function without having to worry about it again (mostly).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step Two: Document\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the *docstring* and follow the full documentation pattern defined in {doc}`../Chapter1/Ch1_5Functions`. We want to make sure we include tests by way of sample input and output as part of the docstring. For this function, it could look like.\n",

    "    \"\"\"Checks to see if guess is equal to, higher or lower than correct. Returns\n",
    "    'Correct', 'High', 'Low' respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples:\n",
    "        >>> check(10, 10)\n",
    "        'Correct'\n",
    "        >>> check(3, 5)\n",
    "        'Low'\n",
    "        >>> check(5, 3)\n",

    ":class: note\n",
    "Random is actually pretty hard to generate with computers, and most languages have a built in way to find random. Searching online, we will find a reference to the python [random module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html). Python has a **rich** library of created modules, that others wrote that can help you out. This is a common one. In our case, we need to find a function that generates a random `int` between the range of 1 and max. Scrolling through, there is a section 'Functions for integers' this looks promising! \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple function to use, but one function generates exactly what we need. \n",
    "```\n",
    "random.randint(a, b)\n",
    "    Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. Alias for randrange(a, b+1).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does that look in python.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from random import randint   ## place this at the top of your file!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    mx = 10 # this will change\n",
    "    correct = randint(1, mx)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I imported the function `randint` I can use it directly in my code just like `print` or `input`. We will deal more with imports later, as there are different ways to import things. However, for now, you now have the ability to generate a random number!\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",

    "#### Adding `__main__`\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, we have been adding the `main()` at the bottom of our file to launch our final program. However, that is not the traditional way to do it. In python, it is common to use this code at the bottom of the file.\n",

This gives me the ability to run the program, or just use the functions separately as needed. You can indeed include any code under the if statement, but for now, we will often just call the main driver for our program. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. The Big View - we broke the problem up into smaller parts\n",
    "2. The Small View - we wrote the code for the smaller parts individually \n",

    "\n",
    "## Play the game\n",
    "Don't forget to play the game when you are done, and let others play it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "Can you come up with an algorithm that is quick at finding the answer?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. maybe for one 1 - 10, you just start guessing numbers in order. Bad idea as with 1-100 that would take a while!\n",
    "2. What if you instead divided by 2 each time, and guessed that?\n",
    "   * 1 - 100 is range, you guess 50, the answer is high\n",
    "   * your new range is 1-50, you guess 25, the answer is low\n",
    "   * new range is 26-50\n",
    "   * Until you narrow down the answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm 2 is a binary search! It is naturally **divide-conquer-glue**, and it dates back to roman times as a very fast algorithm for searching items that are in order.  The next chapter we will explore having more than one item or a list of items.\n",

It has been directly linked towards programming success {cite:p}`VanDeGrift2011`, {cite:p}`Stone2007`. As such, before you move onto the next chapter, we encourage you to write out in a journal/notebook/etc the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are concepts you understand the most? Can you imagine ways to use them in the future.\n",
    "* What are concepts you find yourself struggling with? What are some resources that will help you understand them? See if you can come up with code examples of these concepts. \n",
    "* Reflect on the process of what you are learning, and how it applies not only to programming but problems around you on a day to day basis. \n",
    "* Reflect on items in your life that could benefit from a program to help with the task. Whether you know how to write it not, just think of solutions to things that could be improved with software."
