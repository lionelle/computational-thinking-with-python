    "# 2.4 Conditional Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will expand the number of our operations. In the past, we talked about typical math operations of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `=` . Now we will look at expanding those options to include conditional statements. These statements generate True or False for the answer, also known as boolean values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programmers can use the mathematical conditional operators directly in code. These conditions are requirements of making choices and branches in code, which makes them fundamental operations. The example operations with code are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Condition | Prose | Example | print(answer) |\n",
    "| -- | :-- | --: | :--: |\n",
    "| $a >  b$| is $a$ *greater than* $b$ | answer = 10 > 5 | True |\n",
    "| $a < b$ | is $a$ *less than* $b$ | age = 50 <br> answer = age < 100 | True|\n",
    "| $a >= b$  | is $a$ *greater than or equal to* $b$ | age = 42<br>meaning = 42<br> answer = age >= meaning| True |\n",
    "| $a <= b$  | is $a$ *less than or equal to* $b$ | answer = 5 <= 5| True |\n",
    "| $a == b$  | is $a$ *equal to* $b$ | meaning = 42<br>answer = meaning == 42| True |\n",
    "| $a$  $!=$  $b$  | is $a$ *not equal to* $b$ | meaning = 22<br>answer = meaning != 42| True |\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that conditional operators evaluate both sides of the statement based on the operator / operation type, and then a Boolean value is returned. You need to make sure the types are the same, or it can be a bit funny how it works. For example, if we are taking input in from a client, we need to convert that to a number before we run our comparison. \n",
