    "Enter the generation of reusable code of using a {term}`Function`. While the use of reusable code was built up through multiple groups, we often thank the ENIAC Women [ref](https://spectrum.ieee.org/untold-history-of-ai-invisible-woman-programmed-americas-first-electronic-computer), [ref2](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/eniac-six-women-programmed-computer/) who focused on developing reusable blocks that could be used on different projects. They also developed many of the sorts and algorithms we use today. However, [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) was the first functional programming language developed by [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)) in 1958.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind functions is that you have a block of code, that \n",
    "1. Can be repeated\n",
    "2. Can take in parameters \n",
    "3. Can return a value to be used\n",
    "\n",
    "A {term}`Parameter` is a value that gets passed into the function. It ends up becoming a variable that can be used. A return value is a value that gets passed out of the function. You have already been using both!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-In Functions \n",
    "\n",
    "You currently have already been using a few of Pythons built in functions. These functions someone else wrote, and you are given access to call the function (often called {term}`Invoke`) when you need to use its capabilities. We don't care how it works, just that it works as intended! Here are a few you have used.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin} \n",
    "  ```{admonition} None\n",
    "    :class: note\n",
    "    None is a keyword/type in python that means nothing or not defined. We will end up using\n",
    "    it a lot, but for now, just know, like everything in this book, we will come back to the concept.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "````\n",
    "`print(value) -> None`\n",
    "  : You call this function to print the value to the screen. Value has been a variety of things, but every time you have \"passed\" in a value to the function. This value is the parameter for print to work. We say it returns `None` meaning there is nothing actually returned to store in a variable after the function is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`input(value) -> str`\n",
    "  : input function takes in an (optional) value, that prints to the screen you want the message to read. However, when you used input, you set it to a variable. When you did this, what you were really doing was setting the value **returned** to the variable. In the following example `quest` ends up being assigned the string value returned from the input function, which is the value someone types into the keyboard. \n",
    "    ```{code-block}\n",
    "    quest = input(\"What is your quest? \")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "`int(value) -> int`\n",
    "  : the int function converts a string to an int value, so you can  perform mathematical operations. As such the parameter is a string, and it returns an int as long as the string matches a whole number style format. For example: `int(\"11\")` would work, `int(\"11.5\")` would cause an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "`float(value) -> float`\n",
    "  : A float is short for floating point number or decimal. The float function takes in a string that looks like a float, and converts it to a floating point value so you can perform mathematical functions. For float, *any* valid number  works fine, as you can also add a .0 to a whole number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All four of these functions were written by someone else, so you don't have to write the code yourself. However, the real power of programming comes down to the ability for you to write your *own* functions!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function in python has various parts. The basic format of a function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

These actually double up as tests to confirm the validity of what you wrote. In **Args** you put in the name and type (optional) for each of your parameters. This is also called function arguments, thus the term \"Args\". **Returns** The return is important, so you know what is being returned.
