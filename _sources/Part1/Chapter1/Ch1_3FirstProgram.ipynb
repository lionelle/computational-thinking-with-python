    "# 1.3 Let's Program!\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already programmed on the last page, when you modified the code provided, and then clicked run. Behind the scenes, the browser takes the text file, sends it to the Python {term}`Interrupter`, and then collects the results to display in your browser. You program is always interacting with provided components from the computer. While this wasn't always the case, and many programmers such as Alan Turing and Jean Valentine of the Bombe Machine had to write the program directly in the computer, the modern world of programming is much simpler. Through there work, and the work of countless others, you can focus on the problem, write your code in very specific version english, and then your computer will run it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3.1 Programs are in english!\n",
    "People talk about programming as learning a new language, and while there is some truth, the fact is you are actually learning a very specific way to format english. This format allows another program (the Interrupter) to convert it to instructions for the computer to handle.  The difficulty then comes in two parts\n",
    "\n",
    "* The formatting has to be **exact**. This can be frustrating, and every programmer has wanted to toss their computer out the window. Why? Because it can be something so small like missing a space, but it can be difficult to see the error! \n",
    "  * How do you handle that? Take a breath, walk away, and come back. Often the solution presents itself. \n",
    "* The logic behind building the problem, or more importantly, developing a different way at looking at the world and problems. \n",
    "  * A new way of thinking can be difficult, and this focuses more on the this problem. The most important thing will be taking everything in *small* steps. _Never_ write all your code at once. Instead, write a few lines, test, a few lines and test! We will continue to come back to this. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",

    "## 1.3.2 Python \n",
    "In this book, you will be using Python to help you learn computer science concepts, including how to design programs. This is intentionally stated, as this book is not focused on learning python. Instead, it is focused on key concepts and ideas that are needed to help you become a better programmer. Python was first designed by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) in the late 1980's. It has a large volunteer community base that prides itself on diversity of contributors. It is popular in many fields including computer science, data science, general sciences, english and liberal arts, and more partially because of the large library base and simplicity in reading the code. However, it is also a very rich language with features you won't begin to touch in this book, and that is alright! Often with computer science we learn the foundation, and then as we explore new concepts, we find the tools that we need. In the end, Python is a language, and a {term}`Programming Language` is a tool in which we learn to play the computer. You often pick which tool is best given the problem and domain. \n",
