# 1.1 Computers are everywhere



From your phone to your watch, from buildings larger than multiple football fields to a computer on your lap, computers are everywhere. A computer is a machine to perform repeatable tasks, following a recipe. To add to that, it is a machine that specializes in processing data using these repeatable tasks. That is it. All the wonders we have with todays computers comes down to a machine designed to follow a recipe or better known as a program.  But where did we start?

## 1.1.1 Jacquard Machine

Joseph Marie Jacquard was a merchant and weaver born in 1752, and in 1804, he patented a loom that used punch cards to create repeatable patterns to weave silk. The weave shown is a silk tapestry that took 24,000 punch cards to create. It is in the collection of Science Museum in London. While this invention was not the only of its kind, as it was inspired by inventions of Jean Baptiste Falcon, Basile Bouchon, and  Jacques Vaucanson it was a notable leap in the weaving industry causing much controversy for its time. Why was there controversy? It was feared that it would put weavers out of jobs {cite:p}`Essinger2007`. His system later went onto inspire Charles Babbage also known as the father of computing {cite}`Babbage1989`. 

## 1.1.2 Analytical Machine

Charles Babbage wanted to develop the Analytic Engine, an general purpose machine that could be programmed to solve mathematical problems. The machine was designed to have an arithmetic logic unit to perform basic calculations, and control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops. Essentially, it was designed to perform simple mathematical operations and by following a recipe, it had the potential to solve much more difficult problems. It was the first machine what would later be known as Turing-complete, which modern computers are today. While the machine was never fully built in his lifetime, it has been duplicated and his son Henry Babbage later went onto complete the Analytic Engine with modifications. Babbage also openly stated that the punch card system used in the Jacquard Loom inspired him to setup a punch card system for the Analytic Engine. He had setup two different types of punch cards: one set for instructions, and the other set for storing data. 

However, there was a problem with the machine. No one had a similar formula to follow, and no one had managed to take this idea and make it generalized. Then an individual who worked with translating notes on the Analytical Engine developed a systematic way for the machine to compute Bernoulli numbers. This individual is considered the worlds first programmer, Ada Lovelace. 

## 1.1.3 Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace

Augusta Ada Byron later to become Augusta Ada King was an English mathematician and writer. She recognized that the Analytic Engine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm (program) intended to be carried out by the machine. This understanding that software could accomplish complex tasks by determining the order of which the tasks are handled, and repeated is at the heart of all programming. 

Essentially, she figured out the first way to play the 'computer' as an instrument.

There is much more to the history leading up to modern computers with notable names such as Alan Turing, Jean Valentine, Jean Jennings (Bartik), Betty Snyder (Holberton), Frances Bilas (Spence), Kay McNulty (Mauchly Antonelli), Marlyn Wescoff (Meltzer), Ruth Lichterman (Teitelbaum), and many more throughout the years. We will have call outs honoring some the individuals that brought us here today!

So how does it work with modern machines?
