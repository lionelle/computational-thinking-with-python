    "# 1.4 Basic Operators and Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing up we learn basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, using basic math, we would look at the following statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 40 + 2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "And say the answer is `42`. With computers, we need to store that answer in memory, so we are given the {term}`Assignment Operator`, the `=` sign! As such, if I want to store that value, I use the following\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block}\n",
    "meaning = 40+2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "what we have is is the Expression 40+2, using the addition `+` operator, and then using the `=` we assign value to the variable `meaning`. Programming has the basic operators we learn growing up.\n",

    "| / | Division |\n",
    "| = | Assignment |\n",

    "You will note that `*` is multiplication, and not x that is because how would one distinguish a variable x from the operator x? As such, we have to use unique characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Python uses {term}`PEMDAS` for order of evaluation.   \n",

    "  **M** - Multiplication  \n",
    "  **D** - Division   \n",
    "  **A** - Addition  \n",
    "  **S** - Subtraction \n",
    "\n",
    "So parentheses get evaluated first, and so on down the line. Another way to remember is the mnemonic, \"Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally\".  With that said, if you are trying to figure out the order of evaluation for an expression, the simple answer is you probably\n",
