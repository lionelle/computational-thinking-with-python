# 1. Getting Started: Your Instrument

Melvin Kranzberg, Callaway Professor of the History of Technology at the Georgia Institute of Technology, presented six laws of technology. These laws were meant to be a series truisms that help govern the way we look at technology. One such law applies heavily to the your path towards becoming a Computer Scientist. **Sixth Law: Technology is a very human activity and so is the history of technology.** Technology, programming, computers are all very _human_ activities! 
```{margin} The six laws of technology:

1. Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral
2. Invention is the mother of necessity
3. Technology comes in packages, big and small
4. Although technology might be a prime element in many public issues, nontechnical factors take precedence in technology-policy decisions.
5. All history is relevant, but the history of technology is the most relevant.
6. Technology is a very human activity and so is the history of technology.

A common mental barrier that exists with programming is that, "I just don't understand computers." This is a fixed mindset statement that limits your future capability as a programmer. Instead, challenge yourself with adding, *yet* at the end of the statement every time you say you don't understand anything, this will help you developed a needed Growth Mindset that is required to master programming. Second, when you look at a computer, know the device while seeming foreign is a device that is made by humans to interact with humans. However, before we get bogged down in computers, let's look at another piece of technology that is dependant on human interaction - musical instruments. Kranzberg once presented the following recounting of a story.


```{epigraph}
A lady came up to the great violinist Fritz Kreisler after a concert and gushed, “Maestro, your violin makes such beautiful music.” Kreisler held his violin up to his ear and said, “I don’t hear any music coming out of it.” You see, the instrument, the hardware, the violin itself, was of no use without the human element. But then again, without the instrument, Kreisler would not have been able to make music.

Now think about learning how to play a musical instrument. If you have had the opportunity to play, you probably sounded horrible the first time you picked one up. Depending on your age and the situation, you probably didn't care. Instead, you knew if you wanted to get better you needed to practice. Furthermore, practice is required from someone who plays as a hobby to someone who seeks to become a professional playing concerts for people! This means to master music, one must have a Growth Mindset, seeking to practice and improve. Together, the musician and the instrument make music that wonders all who hear it. 

**Learning to program is the same as learning to play music.** Your instrument is the computer, and the way you play that instrument is through computer programs that you develop. The cool part is when you develop your "song", a working program, your audience member (the client/user) gets to interact with it! This means you must practice, you must keep focused on getting better, because at first - everyone will struggle. Every programmer struggled as you are learning all bunch of concepts as once, and then having to practice them until the program works. The secret in that struggle is that you are learning. Every moment we struggle we are learning. As such, keep moving ahead, and make sure to practice as you go through this book!
